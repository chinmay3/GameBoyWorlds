"""
Pokemon specific game state parser implementations for both PokemonRed and PokemonCrystal.
While this code base started from: https://github.com/PWhiddy/PokemonRedExperiments/ (v2) and was initially read from memory states https://github.com/thatguy11325/pokemonred_puffer/blob/main/pokemonred_puffer/global_map.py, this is no longer the case as we have moved to visual based state parsing.
This decision was primarily made to facilitate easier extension to other games and rom hacks in the future, as well as to avoid reliance on specific memory addresses which may vary between different versions of the game.

However, the code base supports reading from memory addresses to extract game state information, which can be useful for incorporating domain knowledge into reward structures or other aspects of the environment. See the MemoryBasedPokemonRedStateParser and MemoryBasedPokemonCrystalStateParser classes for examples of how to read game state information from memory addresses.

WARNING: The screen capture mechanisms of the parsers rely on a SPECIFIC FRAME being used in the game. This is not a concern with Gen I games, but Gen II games have options for frames. All states and captures in this repo assume a particular choice of frame, and often it is NOT the default Frame 1.
Ensure that your agents DO NOT change the frame settings in the game, or the state parsing will fail.

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Never branch the parser subclasses for a given variant. The inheritance tree for a parser after the game variant parser should always be a tree with only one child per layer.
This is to ensure that we don't double effort, any capability added to a parser will always be valid for that game variant.
If this principle is followed, any state tracker can always use the STRONGEST (lowest level) parser for a given variant without concern for missing functionality.
